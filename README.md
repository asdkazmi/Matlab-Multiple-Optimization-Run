# Matlab-Multiple-Optimization-Run
A function provided for MATLAB optim tool solvers to run multiple times with very huge options to calculate approximated solution of problems and absolute and residual errors etc with a single click. This is developed for Computation Research purpose where we have to solve problem through optimization process and made analysis.
